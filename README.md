# -dcs_fix_after_update-

# Simple python tool to run if you want to optimize your dcs experience.

This is meant to be rerun after each update since I don't know how to automate this bit.

Start by switching to openxr. 
for oculus you just need to switch it to openxr in settings.
use the openxr toolkit to add foveated rendering, maybe even use upscaling but i found that to be quite trash.


## Good practises

Based on [this](https://forum.dcs.world/topic/246767-more-vram-helps-a-lot-with-dcs-vr-performance) article due to a video memory leak in dcs it's recomended to restart the game after a long session. This problem scales with your vram and/or your playing resolution.
