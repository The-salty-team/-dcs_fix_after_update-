# -dcs_fix_after_update-

# Simple python tool to run if you want to optimize your dcs experience.

This is meant to be rerun after each update since I don't know how to automate this bit.

Start by switching to openxr. 
for oculus you just need to switch it to openxr in settings.
use the openxr toolkit to add foveated rendering, maybe even use upscaling but i found that to be quite trash.

do not up the in game pixel density slider, you can set it to lower and then use a higher ss in openxr.
I dont know how much this affects performance, apparently on occulus setting it to 0.5 and oculus to around 2 or something improves it
